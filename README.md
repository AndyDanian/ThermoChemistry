# ThermoChemistry

Program in python3.9 to calculate thermochemistry amount in kcal/mol,
It is used ideals gases model. The amounts are:

* Internal Energy, U 
* Entropy, S
* Enthalpy, H
* Gibbs free energy, G

Also calculate poblation distribution according Boltzmann distribution.

These program can used only with output from Gaussian.15 and ADF. In the
case the adf is neccesary to introduce of energy by mean one file different
to ADF output files.

# Install
